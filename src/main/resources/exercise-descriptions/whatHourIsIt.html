<p>Java has a method that will give you the current time. You can call it by typing this in to the REPL:</p>
<pre>import System.currentTimeMillis;
currentTimeMillis()</pre>
<p>The only problem... it gives you the current time as the number of milliseconds since midnight
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>, January first, 1970!
    Note that it also gives it to you as a long integer (because this number is too large to fit in to a
    normal integer).</p>
<p>Assume the import statement has already been run and also the following line of code: </p>
<pre>var time = currentTimeMillis();</pre>
<p>Your job is to develop a compound expression
    that includes a reference to this variable (<b>time</b>) and evaluates to the current hour (during
    daylight savings in the St. Joseph area). You can experiment with JShell to get it right or try it out
    directly here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> in JShell, the hour should match the clock on your computer if you have the
    expression right.</p>
<p><strong>Another note:</strong> This method may or may not account for leap seconds that have taken
    place since 1970 depending on the operating system Java is running on
    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Date.html">documented here</a>).
    Do not worry about accounting for this in your expression. You're allowed to be off by a
    couple seconds!</p>
