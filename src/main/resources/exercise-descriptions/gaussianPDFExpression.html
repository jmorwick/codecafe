<p>Take a look at the formula for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">probability
    density function from the normal probability distribution</a>. Your task is to translate this
    formula in to a Java expression.</p>

<p>Assume three variables of type double have been declared representing the mean (µ),
    standard deviation (σ), and a value (x). Develop an expression representing the formula to determine the
    probability density. </p>
