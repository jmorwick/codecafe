<p>Take a look at the formula for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">probability
density function from the normal probability distribution</a>. Your task is to translate this
formula in to a Java method.</p>

<p>Your method should have three parameters of type double representing the mean (µ),
    standard deviation (σ), and a value (x). It should then apply the formula to determine the
    probability density and return it (also as a double). </p>
